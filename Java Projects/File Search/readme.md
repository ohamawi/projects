This is a desktop application built with **Java and JavaFX** that allows users to search for text across local files and directories.  
The project focuses on clean UI design, recursive file processing, and scalable search logic.

This application is designed as a learning-focused project that mimics real-world desktop search tools while remaining lightweight and extensible.
